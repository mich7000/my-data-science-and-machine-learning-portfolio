<h2>Loan Defaults prediction</h2>



**Overview**

Most of the challenging part of a financial institution daily routing is to knowing if a loan applicant will be willing to payback or default a loan.

But will the help of machine learning and the availability of good data. a data scientist will be able to build a model from the data to predict if a loan applicant is likely to defaula a loan ot not.



**Data**

The data used in this project was collected from *kaggle* repository.

Number of rows: 615

Number of columns: 13

**Tools**

Python: Pandas, numpy, matplotlib's pyplot, scikit learn, seaborn, and other python libraries.



**Method**

- data loading, inspection and cleaning
- missing vlaue handling
- data splitting and model build
- training several models and choosing the best model (after evauations)
- retraining and tuning the best model
- serialize the best model.
- deploy the model by building a simple web-app
