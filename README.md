<h1>My Data Science and Machine Learning  + Data Analysis Portfolio</h1>

I created this repository to showcase the skills I have acquired during the couple of years of experience in data analytics machine learning and data science.

In this repository you will find projects on **Regression, Classification, Cluster Analysis, Time Series Analysis, Text Analytics, Data Analysis and Other Data Science and ML related projects.**

You will also find some projects I did using **SQL** , and some simulations and statistical analysis uisng **R and  Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet**.

Adding up, I also did some **Network Analysis Projects** and some **Dashboarding** using *Dash(Python library for creating Dashboard Applications)*



Below are screenshots of some of the web applications I built that runs on machine learning models.

1. *Loan defaults prediction web application*

   The aim was to predict whether a loan applicant  is likely to default a loan or no.

   It runs on **Random Forest Model** with *cross validation* accuracy around 77% and  *f1 score* around 84%

   2. *House prices prediction application*

   The motive of this project was to build a regression model to predict a average house prices of a given area in *New Taipei city* given it geo-location and other inputs.

   I runs on **Decision Tree Model with a Good model evaluation.**
