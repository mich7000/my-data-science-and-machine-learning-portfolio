**Task**

* Supervised Machine learning.
* Text Analytics / NLP.
* Feature extraction from textual data.

**Data**

amazon product reviews

Score is either 1 (for positive) or 0 (for negative)

There exist 500 positive and 500 negative sentences. Those were selected randomly from larger datasets of reviews. 
We attempted to select sentences that have a clearly positive or negative connotaton, the goal was for no neutral sentences to be selected.
