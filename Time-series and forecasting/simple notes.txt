# Exponential smoothing
* Is used to forecast time series data with no noticable trend or seasonality.

# stationarity and differencing

log transformation stabilizes the variance, whilst differencing removes trends
and seasonality

autoregression model (AR), we forecast the variable of interest 
using a linear combination of past values of the variable.

A moving average model (MA) uses past forecast errors in a regression-like model.
-each forecast values can be thought as of past weighted average of forecast errors.

A moving average model is used for forecasting future values, while 
moving average smoothing is used for estimating the trend-cycle of past values.
