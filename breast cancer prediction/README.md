# Breast cancer prediction

**Overview**

The aim of the project was to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not. 

* The data used to build this model was downloaded from the UCI machine learning repository. 

* The variable description is found in the folder named "**data**"

**MODEL BUILDNING ROUTINE**

1. Load, inspect and preprocess the data.
2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the data.
3. Split the data into training and testing set.
4. Encode the categorical variables and scale the numeric variable.
5. Train different algorithms on the data and choose the best performing model.
6. Tune the best performing model.
7. Save the model for future development or even for deployment.

**Model accuracy**: 76%
