<h2> Advanced Machine Learning </h2>

These to folders contain a supervised machine learning project which is beyond basic machine learning routine, here advanced techniques in improving the model predictability were used in both projects.



In both project the fundamental model building approach such as:

* Package inspection (as in checking the quality of the dataset).
* Cleaning the data and making it suitable for modeling.
* Handling missing value and inconsistences in the data.
* Performing feature engineering.
* Then training the data on different models.
* Evaluating each model.
* Selecting the best performing model and fine-tuning for better performance.
* Serializing the model for deployment.

You can view the notebook (code) right away be opening  the **html version** of the notebook file.



Advanced machine learning method may be seen under **MISSING VALUES HANDLING** and **MODEL BUILDING & TUNING** stage.

These includes:

* KNN missing value imputation.
* Bayesian approach of selecting the best hyper-parameters for maximum model performance.
* And unique approaches of data cleaning and feature engineering.
